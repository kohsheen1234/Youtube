### **Architecture Overview for a YouTube-Like Platform**

Our platform is designed to handle video uploads, processing, storage, and playback efficiently while ensuring scalability, user-friendliness, and seamless performance across devices and networks.

### **Frontend/Client**  
The frontend is the interface where users interact with the platform—uploading videos, browsing content, and streaming videos. For uploads, the frontend breaks large video files into smaller chunks to ensure reliability and sends them to the backend in parts. This approach minimizes upload failures, even on slower networks. The frontend is built with React (Next.js) for responsive and dynamic experiences, and Axios handles API communication. 

For playback, the frontend uses adaptive bitrate streaming to ensure videos adjust quality based on the user’s network speed and device capability, offering a smooth viewing experience.

### **Backend Services**  
The backend orchestrates the heavy lifting—managing uploads, video processing, and data retrieval. It consists of several key services:

1. **Upload Service**:  
   When users upload videos, this service receives the chunks and uses AWS S3's multipart upload feature to store them. This ensures even large video files are handled efficiently. The service combines all chunks into a single file in S3 after the upload is complete. This design offloads storage complexity to S3 while allowing flexibility for further processing.

2. **Transcoding Service**:  
   Once a video is uploaded, this service processes it into adaptive bitrate streaming formats (HLS). Here’s why this step is crucial:  
   - Users have diverse devices, network conditions, and data plans. Transcoding creates multiple versions of the video in different resolutions and bitrates (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p), ensuring compatibility and smooth playback.  
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming allows the player to dynamically switch between quality levels based on the user’s bandwidth, preventing buffering and optimizing the experience.  
   - It converts videos into standardized formats (e.g., H.264) to ensure compatibility across all devices and browsers.  
   - This process reduces the risk of delivering overly large files to users who don’t need high-resolution streams, saving bandwidth and storage.  
   After processing, the transcoded versions are uploaded back to S3.

3. **Metadata Service**:  
   Video details—like the title, description, author, and file location—are stored in a relational database (PostgreSQL). This ensures quick retrieval of information for browsing and search features on the platform.

4. **Watch Service**:  
   This service fetches video metadata from the database and provides it to the frontend. It ensures users can browse available videos or search for specific ones efficiently. The service also manages requests for video playback, directing users to the correct HLS streams in S3.

5. **Kafka Messaging**:  
   Kafka acts as the backbone for communication between services. When a video upload is complete, the upload service sends a Kafka message to the transcoding service, triggering the processing pipeline. This decoupling of services allows for modularity and scalability, ensuring that each service can operate independently without bottlenecks.

### **Storage with AWS S3**  
AWS S3 is the primary storage solution for all video files. The multipart upload feature allows large files to be uploaded in smaller chunks, which S3 then assembles into a complete file. This approach is efficient and reliable, especially for users with inconsistent internet connections. After transcoding, the processed videos are also stored in S3 in HLS format, ready for streaming.

---

### **Video Streaming**  
To deliver a smooth streaming experience, the platform uses adaptive bitrate streaming (HLS). This means each video is available in multiple quality levels, and the player dynamically adjusts the quality based on the user’s network speed. For example, a user on a mobile device with a slower connection might watch a 360p version, while someone on a high-speed connection might get the full 1080p experience. This ensures consistent playback for all users while optimizing bandwidth usage.

### **Authentication and Security**  
The platform uses NextAuth with Google OAuth for secure user authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access features like video uploads or account management. By using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage sessions, the platform stays scalable and efficient. The authentication setup also includes custom callbacks to store user-specific data like IDs or access tokens, adding flexibility for future enhancements. Environment variables, such as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, are used to protect sensitive credentials and encrypt session data, ensuring the system is secure. Additionally, custom sign-in, sign-out, and error pages can be added to match the platform’s design, creating a seamless user experience.

### **Database**  
The platform uses PostgreSQL to store all video metadata, including titles, descriptions, authors, and the URLs of the files stored in S3. This metadata is used to populate the homepage, search results, and video details pages.


### **Workflow (End-to-End)**

1. **Uploading a Video**:  
   The user selects a video, which is divided into chunks on the frontend and sent to the backend. The upload service assembles these chunks in AWS S3 using multipart upload.

2. **Processing the Video**:  
   Once the upload is complete, a Kafka message is sent to the transcoding service. The service downloads the video, processes it into adaptive bitrate streams (HLS), and re-uploads the processed versions to S3.

3. **Saving Metadata**:  
   The upload service saves the video’s metadata (title, description, URL) in the PostgreSQL database, ensuring the video is discoverable on the platform.

4. **Watching a Video**:  
   The frontend fetches the list of available videos from the watch service. When a user selects a video, the player streams the HLS version directly from S3, adjusting quality dynamically for the best experience.

### **Why This Architecture Works**  
- **Scalability**: Decoupled services and cloud-native tools ensure the platform grows with demand.  
- **Reliability**: Multipart uploads, Kafka messaging, and containerization create a robust and fault-tolerant system.  
- **User Experience**: Adaptive bitrate streaming, seamless uploads, and responsive design ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.  
- **Flexibility**: Transcoding and standardized formats ensure compatibility across all devices and network conditions.  

This architecture creates a platform that’s efficient, user-friendly, and scalable, making it capable of handling millions of users and diverse use cases effortlessly.
